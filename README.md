# Eastern Congo Security Incidents Project 
  
Welcome to the Eastern Congo Security Incidents Capstone Project, which is my final project for the Google Data Analytics Course. 
Since I am taking the course while I am working in eastern Congo in a peacebuilding project, I wanted to find a project related to the local context. 

The analysis is based on the University of Uppsala Conflict Data Programm [https://ucdp.uu.se/], which records security incidents worldwide. I am using the "UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset" (GED). Unfortunately, I do not remember which version I used for the initial analysis, but it contained entries until early 2021. 
Since the context in eastern DRC has changed significantly since then, I did an update in May/June 2023 with an updated version that contains entries until the end of 2022 (Version 23.1.). 
When I was almost done, I realised that, in contrast to the main dataset that is updated and published once a year, there is also a continuously updated version. I thus updated the  analysis again and added the data from January-June 2023 to the main dataset.  

My objective for this project was mainly to apply the skills learned during the Google course, in particular applying R to a topic I find interesting, as I don't really have a background in marketing or business, which was the focus of most of the course. In particular, I wanted to:

- clean and prepare a real life dataset
- use R for summarising the data
- create and try different kinds of visualizations to present the data
- get used to troubleshooting and problem-solving based on help from internet fora and, for the later work, ChatGPT

The main idea of the project is to analyse the evolution of the security context in eastern DRC over the last 20 years, 
with a particular focus on the last couple of years, and to formulate a few recommendations for stakeholders based on the data, if possible. 

I hope you enjoy and please feel free to comment.
